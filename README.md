# Email_Bomber
This is a basic python script for email sending in large volumes to a specific targeted email address.

**Use it for only educational purposes only**

#### Only works when targeted email provider allows you to send as many emails as per your need here i am using Gmail account for which you have to enable the Less secure apps(LSA) permission ON which basically means that now we can connect to Gmail account with username and password specified from our script.

Here I specifically targeted the text email bomb you can also use image and malicious file also, concepts remain the same just a little bit more coding and library importing is required but as the mail size problem may arise so there is no logic of using email bombarding with attachment or with an image.



## USAGE

- Here on this image first argument
--num, where you specify the number of attempts you wanna do on the target email address as shown in the image.

>Then specify the -target email address as the second argument
>example.com


- -server here you have to specify the target email server
> smtp.gmail.com 

- At last the sender name is optional default value is "Bot" 
> --sender

- Then there is nothing else to do just specify your email address and password in the script, from which you wanna send an email and you are good to go.

>Send...
